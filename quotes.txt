    "Some people look for a beautiful place. Others make a place beautiful.",
    "Happiness is not by chance, but by choice.",
    "If I cannot do great things, I can do small things in a great way.",
    "The bad news is time flies. The good news is you're the pilot.",
    "You make a life out of what you have, not what you're missing.",
    "It's how you deal with failure that determines how you achieve success."
